# AmiTCP_NG

A modernised, open TCP/IP stack for 68k AmigaOS — a fork of **AmiTCP/IP 3.0b2**
brought up to date with a current cross-toolchain, extensively documented, and
extended into a **drop-in replacement for Roadshow's `bsdsocket.library`**.

Three things it is, in one breath:

1. **A fork of AmiTCP/IP 3.0b2.** The BSD networking core and the AmigaOS
   integration descend directly from the GPL AmiTCP/IP 3.0b2 sources.
2. **A drop-in replacement for Roadshow.** It provides the same
   `bsdsocket.library` API and the same configuration model and command set, so
   existing Amiga network software — and Roadshow's own configuration tools —
   work against it unchanged, with **no time limit**.
3. **A clean-room re-implementation of the Roadshow extensions.** The
   Roadshow-specific `bsdsocket.library` extensions were re-implemented from
   scratch, using **Olaf Barthel's open-source Roadshow SDK purely as a reference**
   for the published ABI (function offsets, tag values, structure layouts,
   documented behaviour). **No Roadshow code is used, copied, disassembled, or
   redistributed** — see [Attribution](#attribution--the-roadshow-sdk-reference-only).

The stack ships as a self-starting **`LIBS:bsdsocket.library`**: drop it in, and
it brings the whole TCP/IP stack up by itself the first time any program opens it.
(A standalone `amitcp` program build exists too.)

> **Not affiliated with, and not derived from, Roadshow.** This project does not
> crack, patch, disassemble, or bypass Roadshow or any other commercial stack.
> Its goal is *interoperability* through an independent, open implementation of a
> published ABI.

## Features

- **BSD sockets** — the full `bsdsocket.library` API (TCP, UDP, raw), a drop-in
  Roadshow ABI so existing Amiga network software works unchanged.
- **Protocols** — TCP, UDP, ICMP (including `ping`), IP with routing, and ARP.
- **Interfaces** — any SANA-II network device, plus software loopback (`lo0`).
- **Address configuration** — DHCP client, static, or **RFC 3927 IPv4
  link-local** (ZeroConf) auto-assignment when no DHCP server answers.
- **Name resolution** — DNS resolver (`gethostbyname`, `getaddrinfo`, reentrant
  `gethostby*_r`, …) with a RAM-tiered **DNS response cache**.
- **Modern TCP** — **RFC 1323 window scaling + timestamps**; socket buffers, the
  mbuf pool and the DNS cache size to installed RAM, and timestamps gate on the
  CPU (68020+). Initial sequence numbers are randomised per connection
  (**RFC 6528**, a keyed HalfSipHash of the connection tuple), hardening TCP
  against off-path spoofing and blind connection injection.
- **Packet capture (BPF)** — a Berkeley Packet Filter subsystem (the `bpf_*`
  vectors): open a channel, bind it to an interface, set a filter, and read
  captured frames — or inject your own — the raw-packet engine a `tcpdump`/`pcap`
  port needs.
- **Roadshow-compatible tooling** — the extension API plus the full command set
  (`Online`, `Offline`, `AddNetInterface`, `ShowNetStatus`, `ping`, …) and an
  Amiga Installer.

## Status

- Builds, links, and **runs on emulated AmigaOS 3.2**, installing a working
  self-starting `LIBS:bsdsocket.library`.
- **Real-network validated** on an emulated Commodore A2065 NIC over SLIRP: a
  live DNS round-trip, a full **DHCP lease** (`DISCOVER→OFFER→REQUEST→ACK`), and
  **ICMP `ping`** (to the gateway and to loopback).
- **Validated on real 68k hardware** (PiStorm accelerator + `wifipi.device`):
  interface bring-up, DHCP lease, default-route install, DNS, `ping`, and
  end-to-end connectivity over a 100 Mbit WiFi link — where the link-speed window
  auto-tuning roughly doubled single-stream throughput.
- **Roadshow-compatible extension API** implemented (address conversion,
  DNS-server management, interface configuration/query/enumeration, routing,
  network statistics + system status, RoadshowData tunables, kernel `mbuf`
  access, the `get*ent` database iterators, `getaddrinfo`/`getnameinfo`,
  reentrant `gethostby*`, the host-name query **`gethostname()`**, and a working
  **DHCP client**), plus its capability flags.
- **Zero-configuration networking (RFC 3927).** When DHCP finds no server, the
  interface automatically self-assigns an IPv4 link-local address
  (`169.254.x.y`) — ARP-probed for uniqueness, announced, and defended against
  conflicts — so a cable between two Amigas, or any DHCP-less LAN, just works
  with no manual configuration. It keeps retrying DHCP in the background and
  upgrades to a real lease the moment a server appears — see
  [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md#zero-configuration-rfc-3927-link-local).
- **A complete set of Roadshow-compatible command-line tools**, name-, argument-,
  and output-compatible so Roadie, NetMon and existing scripts drive the stack
  unchanged: `Online`, `Offline`, `AddNetInterface`, `ConfigureNetInterface`,
  `AddNetRoute`, `DeleteNetRoute`, `RemoveNetInterface`, `NetShutdown`,
  `GetNetStatus`, `ShowNetStatus`, and `ping`.
- **Machine-adaptive TCP performance.** Full **RFC 1323 window scaling and
  timestamps**, so a single connection can scale past the old 64 KB /
  round-trip wall. The stack sizes itself to the hardware at start-up: socket
  buffers, the SANA-II receive ring, and the mbuf pool tier to installed **RAM**
  (and the TCP window is then sized to each NIC's **link speed**, never above that
  RAM ceiling), and the CPU-costly timestamp option is gated on the **processor**
  (on for 68020+, off for a bare 68000/68010). Both are negotiated per connection and
  degrade cleanly against peers that don't offer them. Per-interface tuning knobs
  — `iprequests`/`writerequests`, `mtu`, and `tcp.sendspace`/`tcp.recvspace` — are
  honoured when set, and `GetNetStatus DEBUG` shows the RAM it detected, each NIC's
  link speed, and the window it chose. More tuning still to come — see
  [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md#throughput-and-memory).
- **Randomised TCP sequence numbers (RFC 6528).** Each connection's initial
  sequence number is a keyed HalfSipHash of its address/port 4-tuple plus a
  per-boot secret, instead of a predictable global counter — hardening TCP
  against off-path spoofing and blind connection injection. The keyed hash is
  light (add/rotate/xor, no multiplies) and suited to a 68000; the secret is a
  best-effort boot seed, as this class of machine has no hardware RNG.
- **DNS response caching.** A small, RAM-tiered cache in front of the resolver
  remembers successful lookups (honouring each record's TTL) and definitive
  "host not found" results, so repeated `gethostbyname` / `getaddrinfo` calls
  are served without a network round-trip. Sized to installed RAM (8–128
  entries), automatic, no configuration — see
  [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md#dns-response-cache).
- **An Amiga Installer** with install / uninstall / preview modes, automatic
  upgrade-vs-full-install detection, and a chooseable install location.
- **Berkeley Packet Filter (`bpf_*`) is implemented** — open a channel, bind it
  to an interface, and capture or inject raw frames (the `tcpdump`/`pcap`
  engine), with the `SBTC_NUM_PACKET_FILTER_CHANNELS` capability so tools can
  discover it. Validated over an emulated A2065 NIC: live capture of ARP/IP in
  both directions, and injection confirmed by capturing the injected frame back.
- **CPU-tuned release builds.** A standard **68000** build that runs on every
  68k Amiga, plus **68020**- and **68040**-optimised variants that emit
  CPU-specific code; pick the archive matching your machine.
- A few advanced surfaces remain deliberately deferred (IP filter `ipf_*`,
  monitor hooks, server API) — see
  [docs/DEFERRED-VECTORS.md](docs/DEFERRED-VECTORS.md).

## Experimental performance branches

The following branches contain experimental receive-path optimisations. They are
kept separate from `main` so that they can be tested and reviewed without
implying that they are ready for general release. **Neither branch has been
tested on real Amiga hardware, and no pull request has been opened against the
main project.**

### `perf-sana2-rx-dma32-ab`

[View branch on GitHub](https://github.com/MW0MWZ/AmiTCP_NG/tree/perf-sana2-rx-dma32-ab)

This branch adds an optional SANA-II `S2_DMACopyToBuff32` receive path and an
A/B harness comparing it with the legacy callback path. DMA is advertised only
when requested and the stack falls back to `S2_CopyToBuff` when the driver
cannot provide a suitable aligned contiguous buffer.

The reasoning was that a driver which can DMA directly into an mbuf cluster
could remove the driver-to-stack copy. The SANA-II specification makes this
callback optional, however, so it is not a generally available optimisation.

Testing with Amiberry's emulated A2065 over SLIRP produced no measurable
throughput improvement. Representative median results were:

| CPU/configuration | DMA off | DMA auto | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 68000, 2 MiB chip + 8 MiB fast | 80 KB/s | 80 KB/s | 0.0% |
| 68020, 2 MiB chip + 8 MiB fast | 242.5 KB/s | 243 KB/s | +0.2% |
| 68040, 2 MiB chip + 8 MiB fast | 421.5 KB/s | 418.5 KB/s | −0.7% |
| 68060, 2 MiB chip + 8 MiB fast | 412 KB/s | 418.5 KB/s | +1.6% |

The benchmark reported `dma_in=0` in every run. Therefore the DMA receive
implementation was built and exercised only through its fallback behaviour;
it was not validated with a real DMA-capable SANA-II driver.

### `perf-sana2-rx-contiguous`

[View branch on GitHub](https://github.com/MW0MWZ/AmiTCP_NG/tree/perf-sana2-rx-contiguous)

This branch adds an independent `sana2.rx_copy=contiguous` mode. For ordinary
packets larger than `MHLEN` and fitting in one cluster, the stack performs one
copy directly into the cluster and delivers one mbuf. The small header mbuf is
retained for reuse. Small, oversized, or otherwise unsuitable packets use the
existing split-chain path. The default remains `sana2.rx_copy=split`.

This was selected as the next optimisation because it works with ordinary
DMA-less SANA-II drivers, reduces mbuf-chain handling, and avoids crossing an
mbuf boundary during later protocol and socket-buffer processing. It does not
reduce the number of packet bytes copied, so only a modest gain was expected.

Runtime A/B tests used the same Amiberry A2065/SLIRP environment and workload:

| CPU/configuration | Split | Contiguous | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 68000, 2 MiB chip + 8 MiB fast, two runs | 83 KB/s | 82 KB/s | −1.2% |
| 68040, 2 MiB chip + 8 MiB fast | 417 KB/s | 421 KB/s | +1.0% |
| 68000, max speed, 1 MiB chip + 4 MiB fast | 92 KB/s | 91 KB/s | −1.1% |

The contiguous counters confirmed that the new path was active, but the
results were within emulator and workload variation. These tests therefore do
not establish a real-world throughput gain. CPU utilisation was not measured.

### Test limitations and next step

The tests run a Podman-built Amiberry image with a licensed Kickstart ROM,
AmigaOS filesystem, emulated A2065 networking, and SLIRP networking. They do
not reproduce Zorro bus timing, real driver DMA, cache behaviour, or physical
network-card interrupt behaviour. No real A2065, PiStorm, GENET, or other
Amiga network hardware has been used to validate either branch.

The current view is to retain both branches for targeted testing. If the
contiguous path shows a meaningful CPU reduction on real hardware but little
throughput gain, the next candidate is a benchmark-only prototype that fuses
the receive copy and IP/TCP checksum pass. That is more invasive and should be
integrated only if the standalone copy-and-checksum benchmark demonstrates a
clear benefit.

## Installing

Grab the release `.lha` (or the `.adf` floppy image) and run its
`Install-AmiTCP_NG` Installer script on your Amiga. **How much it asks depends on
the user level you pick in the Installer's opening dialog** (the standard Amiga
Installer Novice / Intermediate / Expert choice):

- **Novice** — the installer asks **nothing** and takes every default:
  - It installs the **`AmiTCP` drawer** (its configuration + host database) to
    **`SYS:Programs/AmiTCP`** — or `SYS:AmiTCP` if you have no `Programs` drawer.
  - If it detects an **existing TCP/IP stack** (a `bsdsocket.library`, e.g.
    **Roadshow**), it **automatically upgrades in place**: it backs up and swaps in
    AmiTCP_NG's `bsdsocket.library`, and installs AmiTCP_NG's own command set over the
    existing tools (originals backed up to `C:<name>.orig`). Replacing the commands is
    required — Roadshow's own config tools drive AmiTCP_NG down an interface-setup path
    that hangs, so the command set must be AmiTCP_NG's too. Your interface
    configuration is left untouched, and it all runs with no time limit. On a clean
    machine it does a full install (library + the whole command set + a network
    startup + example configs).

- **Intermediate / Expert** — unlocks the extra choices:
  - **Choose where** the `AmiTCP` drawer goes (any volume or drawer).
  - **Preview** — show exactly what an install would do, changing nothing.
  - **Uninstall / roll back** — restore the library (and command) that were backed
    up by an upgrade, or remove what a full install added. **Uninstall is only
    offered above Novice level.**

Reboot when the installer finishes. End-user details are in
[install/ReadMe](install/ReadMe).

## Configuring your network from cold

AmiTCP_NG is configured the same way as Roadshow, so existing configurations work
unchanged. There are two pieces: a **per-interface** file that says which hardware
to use and how to get an address, and an optional **stack** file for global
settings. In most cases the interface file is all you need.

### 1. Describe your interface — `DEVS:NetInterfaces/<name>`

Create one text file per network interface. **The file's name is the interface
name** (so `DEVS:NetInterfaces/eth0` defines interface `eth0`). The simplest
possible file — get everything (address, netmask, router, DNS) from DHCP:

```
device=a2065.device
configure=dhcp
```

Or a fixed (static) address instead:

```
device=a2065.device
address=192.168.0.10
netmask=255.255.255.0
gateway=192.168.0.1
nameserver=192.168.0.1
```

Settings AmiTCP_NG acts on:

| Key                  | Meaning |
|----------------------|---------|
| `device=`            | **Required.** SANA-II driver. A bare name resolves to `DEVS:Networks/<name>`; a resident driver name (e.g. `wifipi.device`) is used directly. |
| `unit=`              | Device unit number (default `0`). |
| `configure=dhcp`     | Lease the address / netmask / router / DNS via DHCP. Omit for a static setup. |
| `address=`           | Static IPv4 address. |
| `netmask=`           | Static subnet mask. |
| `gateway=`           | Default-route gateway. |
| `nameserver=`        | A DNS server. Repeat the line for more than one. |
| `domain=`            | Default domain name. |
| `requiresinitdelay=yes` | Pause briefly after opening the device (some hardware needs a warm-up before it will configure). |
| `sana2.rx_dma=auto` | Advertise the optional SANA-II RX DMA callback; the driver may use it or fall back to copying. |
| `sana2.rx_dma=off` | Disable the optional callback for an exact legacy A/B comparison. |

Roadshow keys that AmiTCP_NG does not act on (`iprequests`, `writerequests`,
`filter`, `configure=auto/fastauto`, `debug`) are accepted and ignored, so a
Roadshow interface file drops in without edits.

For the RX DMA performance comparison, use the same library and workload with
`sana2.rx_dma=off` and `sana2.rx_dma=auto`. The repository's emulated benchmark
wrapper runs paired tests and reports throughput plus DMA/fallback counts:

```
RUNS=5 CPU=68000 ./docker/run-sana2-ab.sh
```

### 2. Bring it up

```
AddNetInterface eth0
```

`AddNetInterface` reads `DEVS:NetInterfaces/eth0` and brings the interface up —
running the DHCP handshake or applying the static address as the file dictates.
After that, `Online`/`Offline` toggle it, and `ShowNetStatus` reports the current
state. A full install also drops in a boot-time `S:Network-Startup` script that
does this for you at startup.

### 3. Stack-wide settings — `AmiTCP:db/AmiTCP.config`

Optional. One `NAME=VALUE` per line; `#` starts a comment. Read once when the stack
starts. The knobs worth knowing:

| Setting                | Meaning |
|------------------------|---------|
| `HOSTNAME=<name>`      | The host's own name — what `gethostname()` returns to applications. |
| `USELOOPBACK=YES`      | Bring up the `127.0.0.1` loopback interface (recommended; the default). |
| `USENAMESERVER=SECOND` | DNS resolution order: `NO` (local hosts table only), `FIRST` (ask DNS first), `SECOND` (local table first, then DNS). |
| `GATEWAY=NO`           | Whether to forward IP between interfaces (act as a router). |
| `TCP_SENDSPACE=<bytes>`| TCP send-buffer size (overrides the auto-tuned default; see below). |
| `TCP_RECVSPACE=<bytes>`| TCP receive-buffer size (overrides the auto-tuned default). |

A minimal example:

```
useloopback=YES
HOSTNAME=my-amiga
```

### 4. It tunes itself to your machine and your link

You normally do **not** need to touch the buffer sizes. AmiTCP_NG sets the TCP window
automatically from two things, and uses the **smaller** of them:

- **Your RAM sets the ceiling.** The socket buffers are backed by an mbuf pool sized to
  installed RAM, so a small machine stays lean and a big one can afford a large window:

  | Installed RAM | Window ceiling |
  |---|---|
  | ≤ 1 MB (e.g. 512K A500) | ~16 KB (lean enough to still boot) |
  | 2–4 MB | ~61 KB |
  | 8–16 MB | ~128 KB |
  | 16–64 MB | ~256 KB |
  | 64–128 MB | ~512 KB |
  | 128 MB+ (PiStorm-class) | ~1 MB |

- **Your link speed sets the target.** The window that fills a link without overshooting
  is its bandwidth-delay product, so the stack reads each NIC's link speed and sizes the
  window to it — ~512 KB for a ~100 Mbit link, ~1 MB for gigabit — never above the RAM
  ceiling. A window *larger* than the link needs doesn't add throughput and hurts loss
  recovery, so on a big-RAM machine a 100 Mbit NIC is deliberately held to ~512 KB, not
  1 MB. (A driver that doesn't report its speed simply falls back to the RAM ceiling.)

RFC 1323 **window scaling** makes the >64 KB windows possible and is negotiated per
connection; **timestamps** are enabled on a 68020+ and left off on a bare 68000/68010
(where the per-segment cost is not worth it).

To override, set `tcp.sendspace=`/`tcp.recvspace=` in a `DEVS:NetInterfaces` interface
config (this is stack-wide — the last interface configured wins) or
`TCP_SENDSPACE=`/`TCP_RECVSPACE=` in `AmiTCP.config`. Run **`GetNetStatus DEBUG`** to see
the RAM the stack detected and the window it chose.

## Build & test

Everything runs in disposable Docker containers — you need only Docker on the
host. **[docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** is the full guide (compiling the
tools, rolling your own `.lha`/`.adf`, and testing your own code); the harness
internals are in **[docker/README.md](docker/README.md)**.

```bash
# The self-starting drop-in library  ->  build/bsdsocket.library
./docker/build-lib.sh

# The full Roadshow-compatible command set  ->  build/Online, build/ping, ...
./docker/build-tools.sh

# A complete installable release  ->  build/release/AmiTCP_NG.lha  and  .adf
./docker/build-release.sh

# Test: fast loopback / API tests, then real-network tests (A2065 + SLIRP + DHCP)
TIMEOUT=95 ./docker/run-fsuae.sh
NET=1 TIMEOUT=150 ./docker/run-amiberry.sh
```

To run the emulators you must supply your own licensed Amiga system files (a
Kickstart ROM and an AmigaOS 3.2 install). These live under `emu/`, which is
git-ignored and **never committed** — see the docker guide.

## Attribution — the Roadshow SDK (reference only)

AmiTCP_NG's Roadshow-compatible `bsdsocket.library` extensions are a **clean-room
re-implementation**. They were written from scratch using **Olaf Barthel's
Roadshow SDK** as the authoritative *reference* for the ABI: the extension
function offsets, tag values, structure layouts, and documented behaviour all
come from the SDK's `autodoc`, SFD files, and headers. Reading that published
documentation (and the SDK's example command sources, and `strings` on published
binaries) is legitimate interoperability work — **no Roadshow code is reused,
copied, disassembled, or included here.** Our implementation is our own.

We are genuinely grateful that **Olaf Barthel** made the Roadshow SDK openly
available. This project simply could not match the ABI so precisely without that
documentation, and we thank him for it.
